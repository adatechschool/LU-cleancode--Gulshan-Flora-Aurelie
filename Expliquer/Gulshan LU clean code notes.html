    <h1>Clean Code</h1>
    <p> Clean code is a reader-focused development style that produces software that's easy to write, read and maintain. Must be expressive. Must be able to read it the first timr you see the code and know what it is about. one class or function should have 1 responsibility. Don't repeat: create a function to repeat instead of copying code. </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Break down big code into smaller sections</li>
            <li>Time limit and dont think about it</li>
            <li> YAGNI - code onky necessary parts, dont anticipate</li>
            <li>software design patters</li>
            <li>If you want to learn something, practice. Make examples and make them work because read about something is not enough.</li>
            <li>When developing a web application, think mobile-first and the associated power and bandwidth restrictions.</li>

        <ol>
            <li>
                S - Single-responsiblity Principle
            </li>
            <li>
                O - Open-closed Principle
            </li>
            <li>
                L - Liskov Substitution Principle
            </li>
            <li>
                I - Interface Segregation Principle
            </li>
            <li>
                D - Dependency Inversion Principle
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        Used to fid design problems
        <br>
        With these principles it is easier to understand and change code. Makes code more flexible.
        <br>
        Need a context to know when and where you need refactoring

        <h3>
            Technical Debt : the process of prioritising speedy delivery over perfect code.
        </h3>
        If you choose to have technical debt, there should be strategy, intention and rationale behind it.
        <br>
        Is it wreckless VS prudent?
        <br>Is it inadvertent or deliberate?
        <h4>
            Technical debt should be context-based, to see whether it is necessary and should be implemented or not
        </h4>
